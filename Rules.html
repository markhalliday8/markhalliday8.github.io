    <h5>Scoring Rules</h5>
    <article>You are scored based on lap speed. The fastest lap wins.You earn one point per player you beat. For
        example,
        finishing first in a race of six rewards six points. There is an individual scoreboard and team scoreboard.
    </article>
    <h5>Team Scoring</h5>
    <article>Each player's points combined equates to a team's score. </article>
    <h5>Uneven Teams</h5>
    <article>If someone drops out or a team has an uneven number, the team with more players will not have their
        additional
        players points counted. For example: Team one has 2 players and team two has three players. The lowest scoring
        player of team two will not count each week.</article>
